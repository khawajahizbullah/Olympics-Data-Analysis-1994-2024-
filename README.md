# Olympics-Data-Analysis-1994-2024-
The analysis reveals fascinating insights into nations’ sports dominance, consistency, and emerging powers in the world of sports.


## 📖 Project Overview
This project dives deep into **30 years of Olympic Games history (1994–2024)** — uncovering medal trends, dominant nations, and shifts in global athletic performance. Using Python’s data analysis libraries, we explore which countries led over the years, how performance evolved, and how total medal counts changed across both Summer and Winter Olympics.

## 🧠 Project Story
The Olympics is more than a sporting event — it’s a global reflection of dedication, teamwork, and national pride.  
As a Data Analyst passionate about storytelling through data, I wanted to visualize **how nations’ performances have evolved** over three decades of the Olympic Games.  
This project highlights the rise and fall of medal-winning countries, year-by-year patterns, and how global competition has intensified over time.
